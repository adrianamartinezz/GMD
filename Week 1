GMD Team met with Dr. Overbye to discuss plans for 404. 
Katherine: 
Adriana: I discussed with Ceci (grad student) about options for best optimizing the GIC blocking devices chosen/placed for a given storm 
magnitude. Python code will be created to help the process of optimizing placement go a lot faster and will run externally using 
PowerWorld's simulation auto server.
