Adriana: 
I have been working on my Python code as part of the SimAuto function for PowerWorld. 
I have been able to successfully run it with my own case (Case 6). As of right now, the code implements a storm on the 
file case with a given storm magnitude and direction. It then takes the Mvar losses and compares them to value 50 Mvar. 
If it is larger than 50Mvar, then it will display which transformers need to have a GIC blocking device placed on them. 
I have had trouble implementing the second part of the code, which is changing the GIC Blocking device from "No" to "Yes" 
and placing a GIC blocking device on those transformers. the command changeParameters is not accepting my input, so I am currently 
trouble shooting that portion of the code. My goal is to have that finished by this weekend so that I am able to run the code with 
Katherine's Dallas and Temple case. 

The purpose of this code is to place devices based on Mvar losses. It will make the process much faster, as I am able to run this code
multiple times without having to make the manual changes one by one as I previously did last semester. 



Katherine: 
This week I have started to add GIC blocking devices to the Temple case. At first I started with random ones just to make sure the 
system would not black out, and now I am beginning to add the devices based on Adriana's research. Based on the early simulations I have 
completed (power flow) the GIC blocking devices are causing the MVar losses to decrease. So far, the blocking devices haven't shown to 
increase the magnitude of storm the case can withstand without blacking out, but that is most likely because so far I have only added 
5 at a time. This week I am going to continue to add the blocking devices, further decrease the MVar losses, and have the goal to increase 
the magnitude of storm that the case can withstand.
