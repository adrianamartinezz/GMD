Adriana: I had some issues with Pycharm and getting the packages installed for my program. I will be meeting with Ceci on Thursday to get my python program on the right track and make sure I can run it externally with PowerWorld. 
I would like to have the code finished by Wedensday/Thursday of next week so that I can spend the weekend implementing it with the Temple and Dallas case that Katherine has built from last semseter. 

Katherine: I have made an asessment of the island scheme files I have, and tested them to make sure they're up and running. I began working on opening
some lines during a powerflow (guess and check process) to investigate potential future islands, no real results from these trials yet. This week I will be continuing 
to work on the island cases, exchange files/information with Adriana about GIC blocking devices/island files, and begin testing the effects of adding some GIC blocking devices.
