Adriana: I had some issues with Pycharm and getting the packages installed for my program. I will be meeting with Ceci on Thursday to get my python program on the right track and make sure I can run it externally with PowerWorld. 
I would like to have the code finished by Wedensday/Thursday of next week so that I can spend the weekend implementing it with the Temple and Dallas case that Katherine has built from last semseter.
