Katherine:
  - Added up to 90 Devices on Temple case in 8 cases. (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90)
  - Simulated storm of 5 V/km, collected powerflow data and exported to excel
  - Before the next update I will add the devices to the Dallas case and begin the validation
  - Hopefully talk to grad student about how I will implement hotspots


Adriana:
-Met with Ceci earlier this week to get help with device placement in increments of 10
-Implemented while loop to add GIC Blocking devices in incremenets of 10 based on a certain Mvar loss. 
-Function works, but while loop does not break when it meets conditions. Currently trouble shooting to figure out why it doesnt 
break when it should.
